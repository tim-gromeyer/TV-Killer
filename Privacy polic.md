# Privacy Policy for TV-Killer App

**Last updated**: July 08, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to TV-Killer, a fun app designed to turn off nearby TVs using your Android device's IR blaster. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our practices.

## Data Collection

TV-Killer itself **does not collect or store personal data** from its users, such as your name, email address, or location. However, the app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements, which may collect certain data as described below.

### Data Collected by Google AdMob
To serve ads, Google AdMob may collect and process the following types of data:
- **Device Information**: Such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), device type, and operating system.
- **Ad Interaction Data**: Information about how you interact with ads, such as clicks or impressions.
- **IP Address**: Used to determine general location for ad personalization.
- **Other Non-Personal Data**: Such as app usage patterns to improve ad relevance.

AdMob may use this data to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your preferences and regional privacy laws (e.g., GDPR for EU users). For more details on AdMob’s data practices, please review [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). You can manage your ad personalization settings through your device’s settings (e.g., opting out of personalized ads via Google’s Advertising ID settings).

## Data Sharing

TV-Killer does not share personal data with third parties, as we do not collect it. However, data collected by Google AdMob for advertising purposes may be shared with Google’s partners as described in their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We ensure that AdMob’s data practices comply with applicable privacy laws.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the app and ensure its safe operation. Since TV-Killer does not collect personal data, there is no risk of personal data breaches from the app itself. Google AdMob implements its own security measures to protect the data it collects; see their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

This Privacy Policy is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect certain non-personal data, such as IP addresses, for security and analytics purposes. For more information, please review the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
